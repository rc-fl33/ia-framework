# Skill Building Workflow

**Career development with progressive mentorship and learning tracking**

---

## Overview

Complete mentorship workflow for skill development and career progression.

**Output:** `private/output/mentorship/{Goal}-{YYYY-MM-DD}/`

**Deliverables:**
1. `LEARNING-ROADMAP.md` - 30/60/90-day action plan with resources
2. `RESOURCES.md` - Platforms, courses, certifications with ROI analysis
3. `PROGRESS-TRACKER.md` - Milestone and session tracking

**Auto-Resource Detection:**
- Resume: `private/input/mentorship/resume.md` (for current skills assessment)
- Learning history: `private/output/mentorship/` (if exists)

**Time:** 15-30 minutes

---

## Philosophy

- **Free resources first** - Prioritize open-source over expensive certifications
- **Hands-on over theory** - Labs and practice > lectures
- **Portfolio visible** - Build publicly (GitHub, blog, CTFs)
- **ROI-focused** - Certifications only if proven job market value
- **Network strategically** - Communities, conferences, mentors

---

## Workflow Phases

### Phase 1: Assessment

**Current State Analysis:**

1. **Skills Inventory:**
   - Technical skills (from resume)
   - Certifications held
   - Tools and platforms experience
   - Domain knowledge

2. **Gap Analysis:**
   - Target role requirements
   - Missing skills or certifications
   - Experience level gaps
   - Knowledge areas to develop

3. **Define Objectives:**
   - Career goal (role, timeline)
   - Skill targets
   - Certification goals (if ROI-positive)
   - Portfolio projects needed

---

### Phase 3: Resources

#### Free/Low-Cost Platforms (Prioritized)

**Security:**
| Platform | Cost | Focus |
|----------|------|-------|
| TryHackMe | Free/$10/mo | Guided learning paths |
| HackTheBox | Free tier | Challenge-based |
| PentesterLab | Free exercises | Web security |
| OverTheWire | Free | Wargames |
| picoCTF | Free | CTF practice |

**General Tech:**
| Platform | Cost | Focus |
|----------|------|-------|
| freeCodeCamp | Free | Web development |
| Codecademy | Free tier | Multiple languages |
| Coursera | Audit free | University courses |
| YouTube | Free | Conference talks, tutorials |

**Communities:**
- Discord servers (InfoSec, DevSec)
- Reddit (r/cybersecurity, r/netsec)
- Twitter/X (follow practitioners)
- Local meetups

#### Certification ROI Analysis

**Before recommending ANY certification:**

| Factor | Question |
|--------|----------|
| Job posting frequency | How often required/preferred? |
| Salary differential | With cert vs without? |
| Cost | Exam + training + time? |
| Difficulty | Pass rate, prep time? |
| Market recognition | Do employers know it? |

**Rule:** Only recommend if expected salary increase > cost within 6-12 months.

**De-Prioritize:**
- Expensive bootcamps ($10K+) without job guarantees
- Certifications without market demand
- Theory-heavy courses without labs
- Outdated training materials

---

### Phase 4: Tracking

#### Session-Based Tracking

**For each learning session:**
- Date and duration
- Objectives for session
- Skills practiced
- Resources used
- Challenges completed
- Next session goals

#### Milestone Tracking

**Long-term progress:**
- Skills mastered (learning → proficient → expert)
- Projects completed
- Certifications earned
- Job applications submitted
- Interviews completed
- Network connections made
