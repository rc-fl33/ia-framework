## Template Usage Notes

**For Agent Developers:**

1. **Replace all [placeholders]** with actual content
2. **Stay within line limits** for each section
3. **Reference, don't inline:**
   - Workflows → See skill's SKILL.md file
   - Session protocols → docs/guides/hierarchical-context-loading.md
   - File paths → docs/standards/file-location-standards.md
   - Examples → Keep 1-2 brief, reference files for more

4. **Prohibited additions:**
   - Long code examples (>10 lines)
   - Inline workflow descriptions
   - Repeated context from other docs

5. **Validation:**
   ```bash
   # Check line count
   wc -l agents/[agent].md  # Must be ≤ 150

   # Validation
   # Required capability: framework-accuracy-audit
   # Pre-commit hook will block if > 150 lines
   ```

**See:** `docs/AGENT-FORMAT-STANDARDS.md` for complete format policy
